# A Blockchain in Python

From [this tutorial](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46).

The tutorial was written in Python 3.6, but I started changint it to Python 3.5.

## Proof of Work

> A Proof of Work algorithm (PoW) is how new Blocks are created or _mined_ on the blockchain. The goal of PoW is to discover a number which solves a problem. The number must be *difficult to find but easy to verify*—computationally speaking—by anyone on the network.
